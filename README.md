An Ordinal Encoding involves mapping each unique label to an integer value, this type of encoding is really only appropriate if there is a known relationship between the categories, this relationship does exist
for some of the variables in our datset and ideally this should be hardness when preparing the data, in this case we will ignore any possible existing ordinal relationship and assume all variables are categorical
it can still be helpfull to use an ordinal encoding at least as a print of refrence with other schemes.
